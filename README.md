## Technology choice

### Java 11

### Gradle
I chose Gradle to build the project because is the main standard in the industry.
The configuration is writen in Kotlin to keep the same language as the model.

### Vertx
This is a list of the most popular frameworks in [Kotlin for server side](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/server-overview.html#frameworks-for-server-side-development-with-kotlin)

I chose [Vertx](https://vertx.io/) because is simple to configure and the configuration is easy to read
